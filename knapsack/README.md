1> **Bruteforce approach**
   In ths approach we populate all the combinations using python itertools
   combination method

   run the program as "python ks_bruteforce.py"
   ```
 $ python ks_bruteforce.py 

 The bagged items are [('a', 6, 30), ('b', 3, 14), ('c', 4, 16), ('d', 2, 9)]

 Max bag weight allowed is 12

 The v_max is 55

 The winning tuple is (('a', 6, 30), ('c', 4, 16), ('d', 2, 9))
```
